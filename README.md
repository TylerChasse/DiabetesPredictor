### Data Flow
- Dashboard.jsx calls loadData() which lives in utils/DataAnalysis.js
- loadData() fetches and parses the dataset csv file and caches it along with the gathered metadata
- Calculation functions within DataAnalysis.js can used cachedData when making calculations
- Individual analytics/visualizations can import corresponding calculation functions from DataAnalysis.js
- Use UseMemo() when calling these functions ( for example: const ageBinnedData = useMemo(() => calculateAgeBinnedRisk(), []); )
- The data returned from these calculation functions can then be used for the analytics/visualizations as needed

### Updating Analytics/Visualizations

- Calculation functions that handle the data directly can be added to utils/DataAnalysis.js (for example, calculateAgeBinnedRisk())
- In your analytic/visualization file import this function and call it using UseMemo (see above)
- Use the returned data within your analytic/visualization
- Add you analytic/visualization into its respective AnalyticsSection/VisualizationsSection
- Any new css that's needed can be added to the respective AnalyticsSection/VisualizationsSection module.css file in the styles folder
